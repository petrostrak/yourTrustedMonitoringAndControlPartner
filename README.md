### Inaccess - Technical assignment
#### Golang software engineer
##### Description
The goal of this assignment is the implementation of a `JSON/HTTP` service, in golang, that returns the matching timestamps of a periodic task.

A periodic task is described by the following properties:
* Period (every hour, every day, ...)
* Invocation point (where inside the period should be invoked)
* Timezone (days/months/years are timezone-depended)

The service should return all matching timestamps of a periodic task (ptlist) between 2 points in time (t1, t2). t1, t2 and the entries of ptlist are in UTC with seconds accuracy, in the following form: `20060102T150405Z`
The supported periods should be: `1h`, `1d`, `1mo`, `1y`. The invocation timestamp should be at the start of the period (e.g. for 1h period a matching timestamp is considered the `20210729T010000Z`). The service should accept as command-line argument the listen `addr/port`. On success, HTTP status `200 OK` and a JSON array with all matching timestamps, in `UTC`, for the requested period should be returned. On failure, HTTP status `400` and a JSON object with appropriate fields should be returned.

An example of unsuccessful request/response:
```
GET /ptlist?period=1w&tz=Europe/Athens&t1=20180214T204603Z&t2=20211115T123456Z
{
"status": "error",
"desc": "Unsupported period"
}
```

#### Run without Docker:
In the root directory of the project, type the following to fire up the server:
```
./run.sh 
```
 (don't forget to add port to listen to, for example : `./run.sh 8080`)

#### Run with Docker:
In the root directory of the project (where the dockerfile exists):
```
docker build --tag docker-inaccess .
```

To view local images (docker-inaccess image should be here):
```
docker images
```
To run the docker-inaccess image:
```
docker run -p 8080:8080 docker-inaccess 8080
```
It's handy to remember that in the -p 8080:8080 command line option, the order for this operation is `-p HOST_PORT:CONTAINER_PORT`

In case you want to delete the image:
```
docker image rm -f docker-inaccess
```
